# Hey there üëã

If you're here, you're either **lost, desperate, or just a classmate looking for code from our lessons**. Either way, welcome!  

I'm **Gon√ßalo Sousa**, an 18-year-old software developer who loves **building efficient and secure software**. I enjoy working on **backend systems, security, and automation**, always looking for ways to make things **faster, safer, and more scalable**.

I mostly work with **TypeScript, GraphQL, Firebase, and React**, but I'm always learning new technologies.  
I use **Arch Linux** as my daily driver because **I like having problems over my system**.  
Right now, I‚Äôm preparing to start a degree in **Informatics Engineering at the University of Minho (UMinho)**.
